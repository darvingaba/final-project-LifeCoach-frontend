        <h1>Yoga for everyone</h1>
        <p>
          These 10 poses are a complete yoga workout. Move slowly through each
          pose, remembering to breathe as you move. Pause after any pose you
          find challenging, especially if you are short of breath, and start
          again when your breathing returns to normal. The idea is to hold each
          pose for a few, slow breaths before moving on to the next one.
        </p>
