          The best exercises depend on your goals and how much time you have.
          You can do one exercise per body part or you can do six. You can do
          exercises that focus on one muscle group or exercises that work
          several at the same time. The key is balance. It doesn’t look too good
          to have a huge chest and a weak back, and it’s also not healthy. When
          you work on one muscle, make sure you also schedule time to work on
          the opposing muscle.

          All muscles are broken into pairs consisting of an extensor muscle and
          a flexor muscle. These muscles complement each other and work in
          opposition to one another, flexing while the other is extending and
          vice versa. Some muscle pairs relevant to weight training are: Muscles
          Part of the body Pectorals/latissimus dorsi Chest/back Anterior
          deltoids/posterior deltoids Front of the shoulder/back of the shoulder
          Trapezius/deltoids Upper back/shoulder Abdominus rectus/spinal
          erectors Abdomen/lower back Left and right external obliques Left side
          of abdomen/right side of abdomen Quadriceps/hamstrings Front of
          thigh/back of thigh Tibialis anterior/gastrocnemius Shin/calf
          Biceps/triceps Top of upper arm/underside of upper arm Beginner’s
          workout Here’s a workout designed for novices. All it takes is at
          least two half-hour sessions each week. For each of the following
          exercises: Start with one set of 8 to 12 repetitions (reps) for the
          first four weeks. When choosing weight, remember that the last 2 or 3
          reps should be very difficult. Increase to 12 to 15 reps for the next
          four weeks. When performing 15 reps becomes easy, add a second set of
          reps (doing the same number of reps per set) or use a heavier weight.
          Be sure to take deep breaths while you are doing these exercises.
          Always exhale during the exertion part (the “lifting” phase) of the
          move. Dumbbell chest fly (targets chest) Lie on your back with support
          under your head, shoulders, and upper back. Hold a dumbbell in each
          hand. (Start with 2- to 5-pound dumbbells.) Push your arms straight up
          until your elbows are almost entirely extended, palms facing each
          other. The weights should be directly above your shoulders. Inhale and
          slowly lower your arms out to the side, keeping your elbows slightly
          bent. Continue to lower your arms until your elbows are slightly below
          your shoulders. Pause, exhale, and slowly close your arms back to the
          starting position. Dumbbell overhead triceps extension (targets
          triceps) Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a dumbbell in
          each hand with your arms extended overhead. (Start with 2- to 5-pound
          dumbbells.) Without moving your elbows, slowly lower the right
          dumbbell behind your neck, pause, and then lift it to the starting
          position. Repeat with the left hand. Dumbbell shoulder press (targets
          shoulders) Sit on a chair with back support and put your feet flat on
          the floor. Hold a dumbbell in each hand. (Start with 2- to 5-pound
          dumbbells.) Bend your arms so the weights lightly rest on your
          shoulders, palms facing forward. Push the weights up until your arms
          are straight, pause, and slowly return to the starting position.
          Single-leg squat (targets buttocks, quadriceps, and calves) Stand with
          your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms out to the side, raised
          to shoulder height. Lift your right leg out in front of you and slowly
          squat down, stopping when you feel like you’re losing your balance.
          (If you need help balancing, brace yourself by placing one hand on a
          wall.) Contract your leg and buttocks muscles to push yourself back to
          the starting position. Complete reps, switch legs, and repeat.
